# Update-Chrome-Bookmark
An extension to easily update a bookmarked page's URL.

Clicking on the extension icon will bring up a list of all bookmarks that match the domain name of the current page. Then, clicking on the specific bookmark title you want to update will replace that bookmark's URL with the URL of the current page.

Particularly useful when reading through threads, and updating the bookmark to stay on the last-read page.
